# Delete alternate characters

# Given a string S as input. Delete the characters at odd indices of the string.

Example 1:

Input: S = "Geeks"
Output: "Ges" 
Explanation: Deleted "e" at index 1
and "k" at index 3.

# Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function delAlternate() which takes S as input parameter and returns the final string after deletion of characters at odd indices.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

# Constraints:
1<= |S| <=1000
