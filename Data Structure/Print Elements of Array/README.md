# Print Elements of Array
# Given an array Arr of size N, print all its elements.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5

# Your Task:
Complete the function printArray() which takes an array arr, single integer n, as input parameters and prints the value of the array space separated.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


# Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Arr[i] <= 105
