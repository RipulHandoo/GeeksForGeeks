# Mirror Tree

# Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.

# Example 1:

Input:
      1
    /  \
   2    3
Output: 3 1 2
Explanation: The tree is
   1    (mirror)  1
 /  \    =>      /  \
2    3          3    2
The inorder of mirror is 3 1 2

# Your Task:
Just complete the function mirror() that takes node as paramter  and convert it into its mirror. The printing is done by the driver code only.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

# Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 105
