# Level order traversal

# Given a binary tree, find its level order traversal.
Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.


Example 1:

Input:
    1
  /   \ 
 3     2
Output:1 3 2

# Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Complete the function levelOrder() that takes the root node as input parameter and returns a list of integers containing the level order traversal of the given Binary Tree.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 105
